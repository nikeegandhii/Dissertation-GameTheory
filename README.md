# Dissertation-GameTheory
This is the program I have developed to calculate the results of the Game Theory model that has been proposed in my Dissertation.

## Libraries that you need to install:
- NashPy
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scipy

## Execution: 
In order to execute the program, you need to open it on Jupyter Notebook. 
As you have opened the file, make sure that you have installed all the libraries that have been listed.
Ultimately, you can click on the "Run" button and the program will execute!

## Input
As you execute the program, you will be asked for multiple parameters.
The first parameter will be the number of blocks that will be in the Blockchain's model.
Then the constant reward parameter is asked, which is a reward that is applied constantly to every single block.
After that, you will be asked to input the probability, along with the computational power for each of the players.
Ultimately, you will need to input the transaction fee and complexity for each block.

## Output
As you have finished inputting all the parameters, the program will take some time to calculate the results.
You will be able to see the Matrix of the Game, along with the Nash equilibrium and the various Mixed Strategies.
Ultimately, the program executes the evolutionary analysis for 10 and 40 iterations.
As the evolutionary analysis is completed, then the program shows both the Replicator Dynamics graph and the Phase space of the evolutions.
